# Hello World

I'm actively working on cleaning up and uploading proper documentation for my personal projects and notes. Most of what you see here are independent endeavors driven by curiosity.
The exception is [CS4732](https://github.com/0U7L13R/CS4732-Cryptography), which is (regrettably) the only class I decided to upload homework for, which I am currently enrolled.

My [wiki](https://github.com/yourusername/The_wiki) is where I keep my collection of notes for syntax, tools, and other cyber references.
