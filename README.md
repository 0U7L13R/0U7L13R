# Hello World

I'm actively working on cleaning up and uploading proper documentation for my personal projects and notes. Most of what you see here are independent endeavors driven by curiosity.
The exception is [Link text]([https://website-name.com](https://github.com/0U7L13R/CS4732-Cryptography) 'CS4732'), which is (regrettably) the only class I decided to upload homework for.

- **Cheatsheets & Notes**: My [wiki](https://github.com/yourusername/The_wiki) is where I collect syntax notes, tools, and cybersecurity references.
- **Personal Projects**: Tools, experiments, and scripts Iâ€™ve written for learning, automation, or problem-solving.
-  **Work-in-Progress Repositories**: Some repos are in-progress or actively being refactored.
